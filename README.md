## About the name

Generalised orthogonal Procrustes analysis (**GPA**) is used to align
individual biplots before combining their separate coordinate sets into
an average coordinate matrix, to mimic Ru**bin**â€™s rules. Finally, this
average coordinate matrix is then utilized to construct a single biplot
called a GPAbin biplot.
