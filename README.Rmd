# GPAbin <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="150" alt="" /> 

`GPAbin` biplots to unify visualisations from multiple imputed data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GPAbin from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jnienk/GPAbin")
```

## About the name

Generalised orthogonal Procrustes analysis (**GPA**) is used to align individual biplots before combining their separate coordinate sets into an average coordinate matrix, to mimic Ru**bin**'s rules. 
Finally, this average coordinate matrix is then utilized to construct a single biplot called a GPAbin biplot.
